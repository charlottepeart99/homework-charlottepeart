Question 1: Definitions

Git workflow fundamentals

1. Working directory - the folder where the current work is being conducted
2.Staging area - contains files that are going to be part of the next commit
3. Local repo (head) - a place for holding all files on a computer
4. Remote repo (master) - a place for holding all files on the internet

Working directory states

5. Staged - a state of the file meaning you have changed it and have proposed to commit it to the main repo
6. Modified - a state of a file meaning the file has been changed but not committed to the database
7. Committed - a state of a file meaning it has been committed and stored in the main repo

Git commands

8. Git add - adds 1+ files to the staging state
9. Git commit - sends the file changes to the local, but not remote, repository
10. Git push - sends committed changes in a file to the master branch
11. Git fetch - detect the latest history of the project from the remote repo
12. Git merge - put changes in a different branch to the paster branch
13. Gir pull - bring the changes found in 'fetch' to the local repo
